    "The goal of this notebook is to process the raw output reports generated by `Kraken2` for all 120 samples (60 T2D / 60 Control). We aim to consolidate the individual read counts into a single, comprehensive Taxa x Samples matrix (Abundance Matrix), which is the necessary input for statistical analysis and visualization of gut dysbiosis.\n",

    "## Methodology\n",
    "The process involves reading 120 individual `.report` files, filtering only for biologically meaningful ranks (Phylum, Class, Genus, Species), and joining the results using Pandas."

Given its known association with insulin resistance and branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, this is a strong candidate biomarker for T2D in our dataset.\n",
    "2.  **Bacteroidetes Prevalence:** The top ranks are heavily populated by *Phocaeicola* and *Bacteroides* species (*P. vulgatus*, *B. uniformis*), confirming that the gut microbiome in this cohort is driven by the Bacteroidetes phylum.\n",
    "3.  **Presence of Beneficial Taxa:** *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*, a key butyrate producer known to be depleted in T2D, appears in the top 10. Future statistical analysis (differential abundance) will determine if its levels are significantly lower in the Case group compared to Controls.\n",
